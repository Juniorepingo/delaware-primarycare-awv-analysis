# Methods & Documentation

## 1. Methods
- **Staging Layer**: All columns imported as `TEXT`. Ensures raw fidelity, especially for ZIP codes and numeric identifiers.  
- **Analysis Layer**: Created typed tables (VARCHAR, INT, DECIMAL, BOOLEAN). Selected only relevant fields for analysis.  
- **Canonical Provider Site**: Normalized addresses to generate consistent `site_key` (street1 + city + state + zip5).  
- **Specialty Filter**: Defined primary care specialties (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Geriatric Medicine, General Practice, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant).  
- **AWV Identification**: Used HCPCS codes `G0438` (Initial AWV) and `G0439` (Subsequent AWV).

## 2. QA Checks
- **Row Parity**: Confirm staging row counts match clean tables.  
- **Duplicates**: Ensure no duplicate NPIs or site_keys.  
- **Nulls**: Check for missing critical fields (NPI, ZIP, specialty).  
- **Cross-Table Consistency**: Validate NPI presence across Compare, Supplier Agg, and HCPCS tables.  
- **AWV Services Sanity**: Validate AWV service counts >0 only for primary care NPIs.  

---

## 3. Limitations
- **CMS Suppression**: Counts <11 suppressed; subgroup sums may not match reported totals.  
- **Address Granularity**: Some NPIs list corporate addresses instead of site-level locations.  
- **Practice Attribution**: Multi-site NPIs may be over- or under-attributed.  
- **Data Quality**: Typos in city names (e.g., `NEWARD` vs `NEWARK`) may fragment results.  
- **Time Lag**: 2019 dataset may not reflect post-pandemic AWV patterns.

## 4. Campaign Playbook
Strategies to improve Delaware AWV uptake (informed by dashboard analysis):

High-Volume Practices
Focus on Wilmington & Newark hubs with the largest patient panels but low adoption. Replicate workflows from top-performing practices in Seaford and Lewes.

Low-Performing Sites
Target cities with large PCP footprints but <5% adoption (e.g., Wilmington, Newark). Introduce workflow redesign, reminder systems, and EHR prompts.

Patient Engagement
Deploy patient-facing reminders (texts, calls, portal messages). Leverage nurse navigators to schedule AWVs proactively.

Equity Lens
Tailor outreach for dual-eligible and minority populations where AWV uptake is historically lower.

ACO Alignment
Tie AWV improvements to shared savings contracts and reduced preventable admissions/readmissions.

## 5. Tableau Dashboard

Distribution & Capacity: Where AWVs are concentrated, top 10 practices.

City Adoption: % of sites active in each city.

Specialty Adoption: Family Practice vs Internal Medicine vs Other.

Benchmarking: Top-performing practices for workflow replication.
